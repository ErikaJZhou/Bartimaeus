# Bartimaeus
BMS player accessible to the blind and visually impaired

**Note:** I had an idea for a BMS player (client software) accessible to the blind and visually impaired but haven't implemented it yet...

## Ideas:
- Accessible UI
- Finding an existing open-source BMS player to work off of, or building my own
- Open source (eventually)
- How to load in BMS files
- Ways to make it easy to bring in new BMS tracks, possibly from some cloud/web app without having to download file to local machine and upload it to the client
- **Game mechanics for a music rhythm game that doesn't depend on visuals**
  - Audio cues (cf. _Finger Dance_ paper)
  - Haptic feedback (but may require specialized hardware, which might limit user access and not work with the *beatmania IIDX* home controllers)
- Bartimaeus the Bat as a mascot
