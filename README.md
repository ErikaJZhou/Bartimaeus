BMS client software accessible to blind and visually impaired gamers


**Note:** I had an idea for a BMS player (client software) accessible to the blind and visually impaired but haven't implemented it yet...

## Concept:
A BMS player/client application accessible for blind and visually impaired people.

Many video games have the "video" or visuals as a key component. This may leave relatively fewer options to blind gamers, or they might have a less complete experience than sighted gamers.

Music rhythm games have audio/sound/music as an important component. If a music rhythm game was playable without needing visuals, it might be something that blind or visually impaired gamers could enjoy and have a rich experience with (Miller, Parecki, & Douglas, 2007).
Theoretically, sighted and non-sighted gamers could compete on a level playing field with this type of game.

## Why use BMS? 
BMS (Be-Music Source) is free and has an active, dedicated community of artists who produce music and charts for/with it.

While some accessible game projects might have a proof of concept or small project developed and then left inactive, the BMS community has produced new music tracks year after year for many years.

BMS is playable on PC/with a computer and keyboard and does not require specialized hardware.

## Tasks/Ideas:
- Accessible UI
- Finding an existing open-source BMS player to work off of, or building my own
- Open source (eventually)
- How to load in BMS files
- Ways to make it easy to bring in new BMS tracks, possibly from some cloud/web app without having to download file to local machine and upload it to the client
- **Game mechanics for a music rhythm game that doesn't depend on visuals**
  - Audio cues (cf. _Finger Dance_ project, _Rhythm Heaven_ Nintendo series)
  - Haptic feedback (but may require specialized hardware, which might limit user access and not work with the *beatmania IIDX* home controllers)
- Bartimaeus the Bat as a mascot
- Browser based, cross-platform. Doesn't require downloading the software onto the user's computer.
  - Or Progressive Web App
  - Or Cross-platform desktop app
- Playable with normal computers and keyboards
